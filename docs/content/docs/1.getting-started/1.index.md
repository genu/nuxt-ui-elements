## What is Nuxt UI Elements?

**Nuxt UI Elements** is a Nuxt module that provides a growing collection of UI components, composables, and utilities that extend Nuxt UI's capabilities. Our goal is to create reusable, elegant components that can be installed via npm and used across multiple Nuxt applications.

## Features

- **TypeScript First** - Full type safety with comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- **Auto-Import** - Components and composables are automatically available
- **Dark Mode Support** - Automatic theme switching compatible with Nuxt UI
- **Performance Optimized** - Lightweight and performant components
- **Nuxt UI Integration** - Designed to complement Nuxt UI, not replace it

## What's Included

### Composables

- [useDialog](/docs/composables/use-dialog) - Programmatic dialog management with alert and confirm methods

### Standard Library

- [plur](/docs/standard-library/plur) - Pluralize strings based on count
- [slugify](/docs/standard-library/slugify) - Convert strings to URL-friendly slugs
- [Date](/docs/standard-library/date) - Tree-shakeable date manipulation functions

## Quick Start

Get started in just a few steps:

```bash
# Install the package
pnpm add nuxt-ui-elements

# Add to your nuxt.config.ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['nuxt-ui-elements']
})
```

Then start using the composables:

```vue
<script setup>
  const dialog = useDialog()

  async function showAlert() {
    await dialog.alert({
      icon: "i-lucide-info",
      title: "Welcome!",
      description: "Nuxt UI Elements is ready to use.",
      color: "primary",
    })
  }
</script>

<template>
  <UButton @click="showAlert">Show Alert</UButton>
</template>
```
