## Overview

Nuxt UI Elements provides several composables that encapsulate common functionality. All composables are auto-imported and fully typed.

## Available Composables

| Composable                                | Description                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| [useDialog](/docs/composables/use-dialog) | Programmatic dialog management for alerts and confirmations |

## Usage

All composables are auto-imported, so you can use them directly:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
  // No import needed - auto-imported by Nuxt
  const dialog = useDialog()
</script>
```

## TypeScript Support

All composables are fully typed. You can import types when needed:

```ts
import type { DialogAlertProps, DialogConfirmProps } from "nuxt-ui-elements"
```
