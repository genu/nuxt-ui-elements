## Overview

Nuxt UI Elements provides several composables that encapsulate common functionality. All composables are auto-imported and fully typed.

## Available Composables

| Composable                                               | Description                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| [useDialog](/docs/composables/use-dialog)                | Programmatic dialog management for alerts and confirmations |
| [useUploadManager](/docs/composables/use-upload-manager) | Comprehensive file upload management with plugins           |
| [useFFMpeg](/docs/composables/use-ffmpeg)                | Video conversion using FFmpeg WASM                          |

## Usage

All composables are auto-imported, so you can use them directly:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
  // No import needed - auto-imported by Nuxt
  const dialog = useDialog()
  const uploader = useUploadManager()
</script>
```

## TypeScript Support

All composables are fully typed. You can import types when needed:

```ts
import type { DialogAlertProps, DialogConfirmProps, UploadFile, UploadOptions } from "nuxt-ui-elements"
```
