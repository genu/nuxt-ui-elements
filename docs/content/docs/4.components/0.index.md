description: UI components that extend Nuxt UI's capabilities.

Nuxt UI Elements provides UI components designed to complement Nuxt UI. These components are slot-based primitives that give you full control over rendering while handling complex state management and accessibility.

## Available Components

| Component | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [ToggleGroup](/docs/components/toggle-group) | A slot-based selection primitive for building custom toggle interfaces |

## Philosophy

Unlike Nuxt UI's pre-styled components, Nuxt UI Elements components are **headless primitives**. They manage state, keyboard navigation, and accessibility while you control all rendering through slots.

This approach is ideal when:
- You need custom visuals that don't fit standard component styling
- You want to build unique UI patterns (card selection, image pickers, toolbars)
- You need the selection behavior but with complete design freedom
